Hello and welcome to this project on bird species prediction.

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,560
So in this project, we will create a convolutional neural network that is a CNN, and it will be able

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,160
to predict a species of a bird with the image that we supply.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,230
So what will do?

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,650
We will use different layers and other hyper parameters for building, training and testing this multiclass

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,730
classification model.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,790
And in this project, we will be using get us.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,470
So the steps we need to take, we need to make this CNN or to solve this problem are firstly and show

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,060
you how you can mount your Google drive on your with your colored notebook.

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,930
This is important because after this, you don't need to download the data locally on your system.

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,980
You can just connect your drive to your Google Cloud.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,940
We will visualize the images that we will be working on.

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,910
After that, we will analyze the dimensions to verify all the images have same dimensions or not.

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,420
The next step would be converting these images into a number and we will normalize them.

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,020
After that, we will check for class imbalance.

16
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,900
If all the classes have same data or not, all the classes have same images or not same number of images.

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,570
After that, we will split the data and perform one two encoding on target paper.

18
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,810
Next, we will create the model.

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:40,420
Architecture will compile the model and and then we put the model after that will plot the accuracy

20
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,040
and the lost against each epoch.

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,990
Then we will reprocess the test data and make predictions on it.

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,630
And in the end, we will visualize the original and predicted movement for one of the test image.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,790
So this project, it can be used for educational purposes because it will get you a better idea of how

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,500
you can create a CNN.

25
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:10,630
You can, for the hyper parameter, doomed the model we will create to reach a hierarchy or to avoid

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,260
overthinking.

27
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,190
It can be used by both centuries to identify different types of words.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,440
So let's start this project in the Google collab.

29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,940
For this project.
